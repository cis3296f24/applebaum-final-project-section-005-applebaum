## Project Abstract
What the product does and how it does it from a user point of view – at a high level. (You can
include screenshot mockup of the interface)
> This document proposes a novel application of a text message (SMS or Email) read-out and hands-free call interacted between an Android Smartphone and an infotainment platform (headunit) in a car environment. When a phone receives an SMS or Email, the text message is transferred from the phone to the headunit through a Bluetooth connection. On the headunit, user can control which and when the received SMS or E-mail to be read out through the in-vehicle audio system. The user may press one button on the headunit to activate the hands-free feature to call back the SMS sender.

### High Level Requirement
Describe the requirements – i.e., what the product does and how it does it from a user point of view – at a high level.

### Conceptual Design
Describe with text (and maybe UML diagrams) the initial design concept. Include hardware and software architecture, operating system, programming language, framework, libraries, APIs, etc.

## Proof of Concept
Include a link to a public git repository. This repository include code using the same programming language, framework, libraries, and APIs needed to demonstrate the tools are going to work together. The code does not need to be extensive, but it needs to compile and run.
It is ok if the code is straight from a tutorial as long it is compiling and running.

In this document or a readme file in the repository, include instructions on how to compile and run the code. Specify the operating system version and the version of the compiler to used build the project.

If your project is as contribution to an open source, you need to show you can modify, compile and run the source code of the project.

## Background
The background will contain a more detailed description of the product and a comparison to
existing similar projects/products. Proper citation of sources is required. If there are similar
open-source products, you should state whether existing source will be used and to what extent.
If there are similar closed-source/proprietary products, you should state how the proposed
product will be similar and different.

## Required Resources
Discuss what you need to develop this project. This includes background information you will
need to acquire, hardware resources, and software resources (Raspberry Pi, data for training
models, ...). If these are not part of the standard Computer Science Department lab resources,
these must be identified early and discussed with the instructor.
